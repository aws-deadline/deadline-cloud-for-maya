# in the base environment it lands built for a single interpreter, and pyyaml hides that by
# falling back to its pure-Python parser on the other four.

    ``native_dependency_paths`` is ordered by ascending Python version and the first tree
    to supply a path wins, overwriting the base environment. The base environment resolved
    these packages for whatever interpreter the build host happens to run, which need not
    be a version the bundle targets, so it must not decide which artifact ships.

    Which artifacts survive follows from how the wheels name their extension modules, so no
    rule is needed per package. A version-specific name is unique per version and so cannot
    collide: ``xxhash`` ships one wheel per version and every interpreter keeps its own
    ``_xxhash.cpython-<tag>-<platform>.so``, and ``pyyaml`` is the same case, one wheel per
    version installing ``yaml/_yaml.cpython-<tag>-<platform>.so``. An abi3 name is the same
    for every version and so collides, and there the two cases differ. ``psutil`` publishes
    a single abi3 wheel that serves all of them, so every tree holds identical bytes and the
    collision is a no-op. ``awscrt`` publishes version-specific wheels for Python 3.9 and
    3.10 and a separate abi3 wheel per Python from 3.11, each abi3 wheel installing
    ``_awscrt.abi3.so``, so those copies differ and only one can ship; abi3 is forward
    compatible, which makes the one built for the lowest supported Python the only copy
    that loads on all of them, and taking the first tree is what keeps it.
